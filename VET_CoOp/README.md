Addon with cooperative missions and gamemodes:

### GameModes

- VET_GameMode_Zeus - Tweaked Editor (Game Master) gamemode which behaves more like Arma 3 Zeus. The "Game Master" <sup>(can we please go back to the "Zeus" name?)</sup> will have to select the faction and spawn like any other player

### Missions

- FIA_Uprising (heavy WIP) - Small CoOp/SP campaign where you play as a FIA cell which tries to push the russians off the Island of Everon. At the moment most of the VET_CoOp components are created for the needs of these missions
