**VET_Reforger** repository contains my mods for Arma Reforger, I'm making these mods as an learning excercise for the new EnFusion engine.

### Addons

This repository contain multiple addons, each of those will be published separately on Bohemia Interactive workshop.

#### [VET_Core](VET_Core)

Core addon with additional functionalities for the World Editor, components and frameworks for mission making etc. you get the gist.

#### [VET_CoOp](VET_CoOp)

Addon with cooperative missions and gamemodes:

- VET_GameMode_Zeus - Tweaked Editor (Game Master) gamemode which behaves more like Arma 3 Zeus. The "Game Master" <sup>(can we please go back to the "Zeus" name?)</sup> will have to select the faction and spawn like any other player

- FIA_Uprising (heavy WIP) - Small CoOp/SP campaign where you play as a FIA cell which tries to push the russians off the Island of Everon. At the moment most of the VET_CoOp components are created for the needs of these missions.
